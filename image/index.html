 <p><strong>Fast food is a mainstay of many people's diets, due to its low cost, widespread availability, and appealing taste. However, fast food also causes a variety of health problems and can sometimes be addictive. Fortunately, by eliminating the temptation to eat fast food and replacing it with healthier alternatives, you can significantly reduce your fast food intake and hopefully stop eating it entirely.</strong></p>

  <div id="1.Write down the reasons why you want to give up fast food.">
     <li><p><strong>Write down the reasons why you want to give up fast food.</strong> You may want to stop eating fast food to improve your health, lose weight, save money, or any number of reasons. Reminding yourself of your reason for stopping will help you be able to resist cravings for fast food when they hit.[1]
Write your reason or reasons for stopping on a sticky note and place it somewhere you'll see it when you feel tempted to eat fast food (e.g., in your car) to maximize its effectiveness.</p></li>
    <ul>
     <li><p> Do as much of the prep work for your meals as you can. If the meals include multi-step preparations, such as marinating meat before cooking it, do these preparations at the start of the week and freeze or refrigerate the ingredients until it's time to cook.</p></li>
    </ul>

  <div id="2.Identify your trigger foods and avoid them as much as possible.">
      <li><p><strong>Identify your trigger foods and avoid them as much as possible.</strong>If there are certain fast foods, such as burgers, fries, or milkshakes, that cause you to crave fast food, it's important that you limit your exposure to them. The less you expose yourself to your trigger foods, the less you'll be tempted to eat fast food.[2]
You may want to institute a complete ban on your trigger foods, at least until you feel like you've gotten your fast food habit under control.
If you're out with others who want to eat your trigger foods, be willing to tell them that that would make you feel uncomfortable. They will probably understand and be willing to eat something else to accommodate you.</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Some healthy ways of dealing with stress include doing yoga, meditating, or speaking to a therapist.</p></li>
      <li><P>If you're stressed out about work or some other task, remind yourself before doing anything else that eating fast food won't reduce the amount of work you need to do.</P></li>

  <div id="3.Eat a variety of healthy foods to avoid feeling bored with your diet.">
      <li><p><strong>Eat a variety of healthy foods to avoid feeling bored with your diet.</strong> One of the more common complaints from people who switch from fast food to healthy food is that healthy food is bland or boring. To avoid falling into a rut, experiment with a wide variety of ingredients and recipes that are healthy but also exciting.[7]
Examples of exciting but healthy foods might include BBQ chicken chopped salad, sriracha fish tacos, or cinnamon baked sweet potatoes.
There are a lot of cookbooks and websites dedicated to healthy cooking, such as EatingWell and Whole Heartedly Healthy, that you can use to find new recipes to try out in the kitchen.
For even more excitement, try adding new spices and sauces to recipes you've cooked before. For example, add sriracha sauce to fried rice or Asian noodles for a spicy kick.</p></li>

  <div id="4.Use fruits, vegetables, and nuts in lieu of fast food as a snack.">
      <li><p><strong>Use fruits, vegetables, and nuts in lieu of fast food as a snack.</strong> Nuts are great sources of protein that will help you feel full when you're hungry and give you energy throughout the day. Fruits and vegetables, meanwhile, are chock full of the nutrients your body needs every day.[8]
Eating fruits like apples and bananas will also help to satisfy your sweet tooth if you ever crave fast food desserts.
Consider carrying around nuts in a plastic jar or small baggie wherever you go so you can have them with you at all times.:</p></li>

      <li><p>You should avoid diet sodas as well, if possible. Although they don't contain sugar, evidence suggests they can still reinforce an addiction to sugar.</p></li>
      <li><p>Carry a refillable water bottle with you wherever you go to be able to drink water no matter where you are.</p></li>
      	<li><p>Limit yourself to 1-2 cheat meals each week, eating small portions at each meal. You should try to limit your intake of fast food as much as possible.
Try cooking healthier versions of your favorite fast foods at home. You may find this allows you to still get the taste of fast food without suffering the health consequences of eating it!</p></li>
